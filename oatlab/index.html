    Theory Laboratory (OAT Lab) at James Madison University</a></h2>
<hr>

<p>
The
<strong>JMU Optimization &amp Algorithmic Theory (OAT) Lab</strong> 
conducts
research at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and
engineering. Our projects range from the development and
theoretical analysis of new algorithms, to the efficient
programming of promising algorithms to solve real-world problems.
Most student projects can be tailored to meet interests in
mathematics, statistics, image processing, digital audio
processing, computational geometry, machine learning, biology, or
portfolio management.

                What is "optimization"? 
            </summary>

[<em>Non-technical description:</em>]
                <em>Optimization</em> is the act of finding
                the
                perfect input to make a function's output 
                either the highest (called "maximization")
                or the lowest (called "minimization"). 
                For instance, we may seek to <em>maximize</em> 
                the expected
profit of a company or the energy efficiency of a power plant. On
the other hand, we may seek to <em>minimize</em> the error of a
machine learning model (often called "training an AI"), or the
losses in a foodbank distribution network.
                </p>
                <p>
                Our lab works on developing new and
                improved <em>optimization algorithms</em>, i.e.,
                techniques for having a computer help us calculate a
                solution to an optimization problem. We use
                mathematical techniques to prove that these
                algorithms solve the problem at-hand, and
                we implement these algorithms in code to solve
                real-world problems.

We (A) develop algorithms that improve the state-of-the-art,

        <b>How do you "prove an algorithm works"?</b>
    </summary>

    <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>
[<em>This explanation assumes an introductory understanding of
    sequences</em>] An "algorithm" is really just a fancy way of
creating a sequence. Mathematically, we seek to prove that the
sequence converges to a solution of the problem we're trying
to solve. This requires (A) modeling the problem we're trying to
solve mathematically, (B) characterizing a "solution"
mathematically, and (C) proving that our algorithm converges to a
solution. In practice, this involves a lot of head-scratching and
staring at blackboards.

    <summary>
<b> What programming languages do you use? </b>
    </summary>

    <div class="dropdown-content">
<p>
We usually use <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>, although
some prototyping is also done in
Python or Octave (which is like MATLAB, but free/open-source).
</p>
<p>
We have computing resources available on-campus for prototyping of
small projects, and we use the JMU High Performance Computing
cluster for larger jobs. Experience with the programs
<code>git</code>,
<code>vi(m)</code>, <code>ssh</code>,
<code>sshfs</code>, and <code>slurm</code> are a plus, but most
students learn it on the job just fine.

Do I need programming experience to research with the OAT Lab?
</b></summary>

<div class="dropdown-content">
<p>
Programming experience is not required. Our projects
range the on spectrum from
"purely theoretical" to "purely computational". This is a great
place to learn about both theory and programming; successful
students are usually motivated to learn both. Teams often start
with complementary skills to match the project, so theoreticians
may be placed with programmers.

<b> When should I apply to the OAT Lab? What if I don't have any
    experience doing [X]? What if I'm in year [Y] of my
    degree?</b>
    </summary>

    <div class="dropdown-content"> 
<p>
        If you are a student who is
        interested in mathematics, optimization, scientific
        computation, and/or data science, then I encourage you to
        apply. Applications for independent study and/or honors
        theses can always be updated.
</p>
<p><strong>[Year]</strong> We consider students in all years of
experience; early students have great potential for long-term
projects, and later students have more coursework expertise -- we
are happy to have both.
</p>

<p>
<strong>[Prerequisites]</strong> Most of our projects require some knowledge of linear
        algebra (inner product spaces), calculus
        (sequences/series), programming, and optimization.
         However, <strong>there is <em>no expectation</em> to know
            all of these
            topics at the beginning - just an eagerness to learn.
            </strong> 
            If curious about JMU classes: MATH 236 can be quite
            helpful for early students.
            Further JMU classes that cover these topics
            include MATH 237, 248, 300, 340, 410, and 434
            (although, again, these are not prerequisites; students
            will be expected to learn the necessary topics while
            they conduct research).
</p>
<p>
<strong>[Major]</strong>
We accept applications from all majors, and we value the
breadth of expertise that comes with cross-disciplinary teams.
</p>
        <p>
        Unfortunately, there is sometimes a <a
                                             href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/">bias</a>
        in applicants who feel "qualified." No matter who you are,
        or what your background is, we especially encourage you to
        apply (here and in general), even if you are unsure about
        qualifications.

<b> Does the OAT Lab have any open positions? How do I join?</b>
    </summary>

    <div class="dropdown-content">
<p>
We are always looking for motivated students to join our team! We
usually have a limited number of positions, subject to a wait-list
and project availability. There are two types of positions:
<em>Independent studies</em> (for research credit hours, including
Honors thesis) and
<em>Research Assistantships</em> (funded).
</p>

<p>
If you are from a non-JMU institution and interested in unfunded or
virtual participation in
the OAT Lab's research, please send an e-mail to Dr. Woodstock
using the "independent study" guidelines.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Independent Study / Honors thesis:</strong>
Applications for independent study are reviewed on a rolling basis.
To apply, send an <a href="mailto:woodstzc@jmu.edu">email</a>
titled "Undergraduate Research Application" with a transcript
(unofficial is fine) and a brief statement explaining
what projects/topics interest you. One may also optionally submit a
resum√©/CV detailing relevant experience (e.g., programming,
self-study, prior coursework, etc.). </p>

<p>
<strong>Research Assistantships:</strong>
Currently, there are no open RA positions. Please <a
                                                href="https://jmu.questionpro.com/oatlab">sign
                                                up for our email
                                                list</a>
to receive announcements when RA positions open up.
