We prove that the block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe (BCFW) algorithm
converges with state-of-the-art rates in both convex and nonconvex
settings under a very mild "block-iterative" assumption, newly
allowing for (I) progress without activating the most-expensive
linear minimization oracle(s), LMO(s), at every iteration, (II)
parallelized updates that do not
require all LMOs, and therefore (III) deterministic parallel update
strategies that take into account the numerical cost of the
problem's LMOs. Our results
apply for short-step BCFW as well as an
adaptive method for convex functions. New relationships between
updated coordinates and primal progress are proven, and 
a favorable speedup is demonstrated using
