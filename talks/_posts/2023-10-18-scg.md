Classical Conditional Gradient minimization algorithms enforce a single closed convex constraint using its linear minimization oracle (LMO). We develop and analyze a method for minimization over an intersection of multiple sets without computing the LMO of their intersection (which is often computationally expensive) - instead, we use LMOs for the individual sets.
