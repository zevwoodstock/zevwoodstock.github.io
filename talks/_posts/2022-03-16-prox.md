Proximity operators are tools which use first-order information to
solve optimization problems. However, unlike gradient-based
methods, algorithms involving proximity operators are guaranteed to
work in nonsmooth settings. This expository talk will discuss the
mathematical and numerical properties of proximity operators, how
to compute them, algorithms involving them, and advice on
implementation.

<em>This is an <b>informal</b> expository presentation with a
target audience of students with a bit of background in
optimization.</em>
