Under consideration are multicomponent minimization problems involving a separable nonsmooth convex function penalizing the components individually, and nonsmooth convex coupling terms penalizing linear mixtures of the components. We investigate the application of block-activated proximal algorithms for solving such problems, i.e., algorithms which, at each iteration, need to use only a block of the underlying functions, as opposed to all of them as in standard methods. For smooth coupling functions, several block-activated algorithms exist and they are well understood. By contrast, in the fully nonsmooth case, few block-activated methods are available and little effort has been devoted to assessing them. Our goal is to shed more light on the implementation, the features, and the behavior of these algorithms, compare their merits, and provide machine learning and image recovery experiments illustrating their performance.
