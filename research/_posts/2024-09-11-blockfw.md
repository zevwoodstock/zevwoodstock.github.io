We prove that the block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe (BCFW) algorithm
converges with state-of-the-art rates in both convex and nonconvex
settings under a very mild "block-iterative" assumption, newly
allowing for (I) progress without activating the most-expensive
linear minimization oracle(s), LMO(s), at every iteration, (II)
parallelized updates that do not require all LMOs, and therefore
(III) deterministic parallel update strategies that take into
account the numerical cost of the problem's LMOs. Our results apply
for short-step BCFW as well as an adaptive method for convex
functions. New relationships between updated coordinates and primal
progress are proven, and a favorable speedup is demonstrated using
