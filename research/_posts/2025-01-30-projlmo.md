This note demonstrates that, for all compact convex sets,
high-precision linear minimization can be performed via
a single evaluation of the projection and a scalar-vector
multiplication. In consequence, if $\varepsilon$-approximate linear
minimization takes at least $L(\varepsilon)$ vector-arithmetic operations
and projection requires $P$ operations, then 
$\mathcal{O}(P)\geq \mathcal{O}(L(\varepsilon))$ is guaranteed. 
This concept is expounded with examples, an explicit error
bound, and an exact linear minimization result for polyhedral sets.
