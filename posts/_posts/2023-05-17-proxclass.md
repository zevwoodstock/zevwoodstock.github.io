These notes are supplementary material to a "crash
course" I am teaching in May of 2023. The topic is proximity
operators and nonsmooth convex optimization.
These notes are not meant to be used as a standalone resource.
Please cite peer-reviewed material. Please send me typos and errors
via e-mail; If you want feedback on the homework exercises, drop
them off at my office (ZIB 3107).

These notes will be updated live as the class continues.
