These notes are supplementary material to an unofficial "crash
course" I am teaching in May of 2023. These notes are not meant to
be used as a standalone resource. Please cite peer-reviewed
material. Please send me typos and errors via e-mail; If you want
feedback on the homework exercises, drop them off at my office
(ZIB 3107).

These notes will be updated live as the class continues.
