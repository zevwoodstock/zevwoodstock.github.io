                About me
            </h2>
            <hr>

	    <p>
I research nonsmooth optimization, splitting algorithms, machine
learning, and monotone operator theory. My collaborators and I 
develop these tools to solve nonlinear problems in data
science, signal/image/audio processing, and large-scale
optimization.
	    </p>

	<p> Of particular interest is the development of 
theoretically-sound practices for data science. I work towards
deriving mathematically-precise guarantees of privacy, equity, and
optimality.
	</p>

	<p> I am a postdoctoral researcher working with <a
		href="https://pokutta.com/">Sebastian Pokutta</a> at the
	<a href="https://iol.zib.de/">
	Interactive Optimization and Learning Lab</a>, 
which is both part of the Institute of Mathematics at Technische
Universit√§t Berlin and the AI for Society, Science, and Technology
(AISST) Department at the Zuse-Institute Berlin. 	</p>

	    <p>
Before my current position, I was
a graduate student and NSF Fellow at North Carolina State
University, advised by
<a href="https://pcombet.math.ncsu.edu/">Patrick L.  Combettes</a>.
My <a href="media/publications/thesis.pdf">PhD thesis</a>, titled
"Construction of Functions from Nonlinear Transformations," was on
algorithm development, signal recovery, modeling, and nonlinear
analysis. I received an excellent undergraduate training at James
Madison University, and I completed several REU programs in the
USA. On a personal note, I am from the blue ridge mountains of
Appalachia. I enjoy cooking, ultimate frisbee, bluegrass,
and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
