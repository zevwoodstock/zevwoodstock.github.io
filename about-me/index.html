                About me
            </h2>
            <hr>

	    <p>
I research nonsmooth optimization, splitting algorithms, machine
learning, and monotone operator theory. My collaborators and I 
develop these tools to solve nonlinear problems in data
science, signal/image/audio processing, and large-scale
optimization.
	    </p>

	<p> Of particular interest is the development of 
theoretically-sound practices for data science. I work towards
deriving mathematically-precise guarantees of privacy, equity, and
optimality.
	</p>

	<p> I am an assistant professor of Applied Mathematics at
                James Madison University (JMU) in the <a
href="https://www.jmu.edu/mathstat/index.shtml">Department
of Mathematics and Statistics</a>. 
	    <p>
Before my current position, I was a postdoctoral researcher working
with <a href="https://pokutta.com/">Sebastian Pokutta</a> at the
<a href="https://iol.zib.de/"> Interactive Optimization and
Learning (IOL) Lab</a>, which is both part of the Institute of
Mathematics at Technische Universität Berlin and the AI for
Society, Science, and Technology Department at the Zuse-Institute Berlin.
As an NSF Graduate Research Fellow at North Carolina State
University, I was advised by
<a href="https://pcombet.math.ncsu.edu/">Patrick L. Combettes</a>.
My <a href="/media/publications/thesis.pdf">PhD thesis</a> 
was on nonlinear analysis, algorithm development, signal recovery,
and modeling. I majored in Mathematics at JMU,
and I participated in several undergraduate research programs in
the USA with <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~annejls/">Anne
Shiu</a> (Texas A&amp;M), <a
href="https://educ.jmu.edu/~nelsonhy/">Hala Nelson</a> (JMU), and
<a
href="https://www.jmu.edu/mathstat/undergrad-research/aeroacoustics-lab.shtml">Caroline
Lubert</a> (JMU).
On a personal note, I am from the Blue Ridge Mountains of
Appalachia. I enjoy cooking, ultimate frisbee, bluegrass,
and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

        If you are a (current or prospective) JMU student who is
        interested in mathematics, optimization, scientific
        computation, and/or data science, then I encourage you to
        apply. Most of my projects require some knowledge of linear
        algebra (inner product spaces), calculus
        (sequences/series), programming, and optimization;
        however, there is no expectation to know all of these
        topics at the beginning - just an eagerness to learn. 
        <p>
        Unfortunately, there is sometimes a <a
                                             href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/">bias</a>
        in applicants who feel "qualified." If you
        feel you belong to an underrepresented group in STEM, I
        especially encourage you to apply (here and in general),
        even if you are unsure about qualifications.
        </p>
        <p>
To apply, send an <a href="mailto:woodstzc@jmu.edu">email</a>
titled "Undergraduate Research Application", with a transcript
(unofficial is fine) and a brief statement explaining
what projects/topics interest you. One may also optionally submit a
resumé/CV detailing relevant experience. Review of student
applications
will begin in Summer 2025.

      If you are
interested in my work affiliated with the <a
  href="https://iol.zib.de/">IOL lab</a> in Berlin, please <a
  href=" https://iol.zib.de/openings/ ">let us know</a>! If a
  Berlin-based advisor is available, I can co-supervise projects,
